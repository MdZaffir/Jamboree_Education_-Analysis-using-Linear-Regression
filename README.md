# Jamboree_Education_-Analysis-using-Linear-Regression
Project analyzes factors influencing graduate admissions using a dataset provided by Jamboree Edu. By EDA and building a Linear Regression model, the goal is to predict the chances of a student being admitted to an college by using tools as multicollinearity, normality, homoscedasticity, and evaluating performance using  MAE, RMSE, R2, and Adj R2.
1. Project Name:
"Graduate Admission Predictor - Linear Regression Model"

2. Project Description:
This project analyzes factors influencing graduate admissions using a dataset provided by Jamboree Education. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and building a Linear Regression model, the goal is to predict the chances of a student being admitted to an Ivy League college.

Key aspects of this project include:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the distribution and relationships between key variables like GRE, TOEFL scores, GPA, etc.
Linear Regression: Testing assumptions such as multicollinearity, normality, homoscedasticity, and evaluating model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, R2, and Adjusted R2.
Actionable Insights & Recommendations: Based on the analysis, identifying the most significant factors affecting graduate admissions and suggesting improvements.
This project showcases how statistical techniques can be applied to understand graduate admissions data and develop predictive models.
